### Hi there! 😁
My name is Vittoria I'm 21 years old from Brazil. I'm a student of Computer Engineering and I have been working with software development for 1 year.

I am passionate about physics, science and computing. In my free time I like to play League of legends, watch movies, draw and play with my dog Laika.
